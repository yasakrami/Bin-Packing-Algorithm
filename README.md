# Bin Packing Problem Solver

## Description

This program solves the bin packing problem, where objects of various weights need to be packed into containers, with each container having a maximum weight capacity of 10 pounds. The algorithm used here places objects with the largest weight into the first available bin where they fit.

### Usage

1. Run the program and enter the total number of objects you want to pack.

2. Enter the weight of each object, separated by spaces.

3. The program will calculate the number of containers needed to pack all the objects and display the contents of each container.

### Sample Output

Here is a sample run of the program:

Enter the number of objects: 6
Enter the weights of the objects: 7 5 2 3 5 8

Container 1 contains objects with weight 8 2
Container 2 contains objects with weight 7 3
Container 3 contains objects with weight 5
